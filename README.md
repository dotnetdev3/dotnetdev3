### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

  With extensive experience of 10+ years, I specialize in full-stack .NET development, emphasizing efficient, high-quality software solutions. 

  My entrepreneurial spirit coupled with my deep technical proficiency ensures that projects not only meet but exceed client's expectations.


  Technical Expertise:
  
  - Primary Technologies: C#, .NET ( 5, 6, 7 ), ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, Blazor, Sitecore, Umbraco, DevExpress, and MS Azure Cloud.
  - Frontend Frameworks: Angular (6+), Kendo UI, Telerik, NW.js, Backbone.js, React, Redux, Typescript, Knockout, and Vanilla JS.
  - Backend & Integration: ASP.NET Web API, IIS, Entity Framework Core, REST/SOAP API development.
  - Databases: MSSQL, ArangoDB, PL/SQL, Transact-SQL, MS Access.
  - DevOps & Infrastructure: CI/CD, Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes, Git/Bitbucket, Azure/AWS, Terraform, CircleCI, Heroku, and Linux.
  - Architecture : Monolithic, Microservices, Multi-Tenant


  I have vast knowledge on Microsoft stack (.NET Platform, Windows Server, IIS) and I am very open-minded about learning new technologies.
  
  I feel pretty fortunate that my chosen profession is something I'm both good at and really like doing, which seems to be rare among people in general.
